    "# WHAT IS MARKDOWN?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by **John Gruber** in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to learn more about markdown, check out this website - www.markdownguide.org<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it."
